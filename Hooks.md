  <h2>What useMemo Does</h2>
  <p>
    useMemo lets you memoize (remember) a computed value so that it doesn't get recalculated on every render, unless its dependencies change.
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>This is useful when: </dt>
    <dd>
      <ul>
        <li>The calculation is expensive (takes time or resources).</li>
        <li>You want to avoid unnecessary re-computations when unrelated state changes.</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
  </dl>
